# About the Results Tracker

![](../app-screenshots/results-track-first.png){: loading=lazy width="550" align=right } This tab will help you create and fill out the Results Tracker(s). Each Results Tracker provides an annotated inventory of all results included in a multi-result file. The depth and extent of information included in a Results Tracker will be determined by the approach you have chosen for annotation of your data.

You will have one Results Tracker for **each** multi-result file (e.g., manuscript, poster, etc.) that you share. If you only have one multi-result file that you are planning to share, you will only have one Results Tracker. However, if you have multiple multi-result files, you will have a Results Tracker for each multi-result file.

!!! note "A Note on the Results Tracker"

    Unlike the Experiment Tracker and Resource Tracker shells, which automatically appeared in your dsc-pkg folder, you will create the Results Tracker(s) through the process of adding individual results.
