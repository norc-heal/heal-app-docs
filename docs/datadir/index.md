# About the Data Package Tab

![](../app-screenshots/windows-gui.PNG){: loading=lazy width="550" align=right }The Data Package tab will always be the first place you visit when you open the data packaging tool. The Data Package directory is where all of your data packaging documentation will live, including your studyâ€™s experiment tracker, resource tracker, results trackers, and data dictionaries.   

The first time you open the data packaging tool, you will need to [create a Data Package directory](pkgdir.md). After you have created your Data Package directory, you will not need to do so again. However, each time you open the data packaging tool, you will first need to [set your working data package directory](setdir.md) (e.g., provide the path to your existing data package directory). This will enable the tool to interface with the data package folder during your session. 

Once you have created or set your working data package directory, throughout your session, the window at the top of the tool will display your working data package directory.

You will also return to the Data Package tab after you have finished your local data package, including documenting all resources, experiments, and results. The [Prepare Data Package for Submission](prepare.md) will help you to assemble a zip file of only those study files/resources you intend to share along with supporting documentation for submission to a repository.
