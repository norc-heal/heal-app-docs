# Setting Your Working Data Package Directory

Although you will only need to create your data package once, you will need to set your data package working directory each time you open the tool. This will allow the tool to interface with your data packaging folder and its contents. To set your working data package directory:

1. Navigate to the "Create or Continue Data Package" and select "Continue Existing Data Package."

2. Navigate to the data packaging directory on which you would like to work and select the folder.
3. Once you select the directory, the User Status Message Box will print out the result that your working data package directory has been set. The file path to your working data package directory will also appear in the box at the top of the tool. This path will remain at the top of the tool throughout your session.
