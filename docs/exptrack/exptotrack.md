# Adding an Experiment to the Experiment Tracker

1. After adding a new experiment, you will need to add it to your study's Experiment Tracker. Close the "Annotate a new experiment" window and select "Add experiment to tracker" in the "Add Experiment" tab.

2. When the File Explorer window pops up, navigate to the dsc-pkg folder and select the text file you want to add to the tracker. 

    1. For the first experiment added, the file name will be "exp-trk-exp-1".

3. Your experiment will be written to the experiment tracker. The User Status Message Box will print a confirmation:

4. Navigate to your dsc-pkg folder in your File Explorer and open your Experiment Tracker file. Confirm your experiment appears in the tracker.

    * This step is not required, but it is recommended you check the tracker output after adding your first experiment to ensure the output looks correct.

!!! note "Viewing the Tracker"

    If you want to review your Experiment Tracker at any point, you can [view the current tracker within the tool](viewexp.md) to identify whether there are errors or changes to be made.
