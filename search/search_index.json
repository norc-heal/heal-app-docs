This tool was developed to help ease the burden of understanding and effectively fulfilling HEAL data sharing requirements. This tool provides you with easy to fill out forms and added guidance that will help you to document and annotate your study's experiments, results, and resources to maximize your study's findability and replicability by future researchers. When you fill out these forms, the tool will package up the information into different trackers, which you will then deposit into the repository you choose, along with your other data package components, as supporting documentation. The tool and the resulting trackers will provide systematic annotation of your data package, which will make your data package more understandable and usable for researchers interested in the data. For more information on the data packaging process, such as how to prepare your data and supporting documents before starting your package and how to determine your annotation approach, refer to [data packaging conceptual best practices]. The Trackers \u00b6 The tool builds three different trackers that provide a standardized way to supply supporting annotation in conjunction with shared data: experiment tracker, resource tracker, and results tracker. Information on the purpose and general content of each tracker is in the table below. Tracker Purpose Content Experiment tracker Provides contextual information on the experiments involved in the project Details each experiment, including research questions, approach, and hypotheses Resource tracker Provides inventory and annotated information for all data and supporting files List of data and non-data/supporting files, including description, path, and dependencies Results tracker Provides detailed information on all multi-result files List of each result, including type and description; there should be one results tracker per multi-result file","title":"About the HEAL Data Packaging Tool"},{"location":"#heal-data-packaging-tool","text":"","title":"HEAL Data Packaging Tool"},{"location":"#purpose-of-the-tool","text":"Compiling and accurately documenting the aspects of your study's data and supporting documents in a way that will be understandable and usable for future researchers can be a difficult task.
