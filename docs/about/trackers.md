# The Trackers

The tool builds three different trackers that provide a standardized way to supply supporting annotation (metadata) in conjunction with your shared data: an experiment tracker, a resource tracker, and a results tracker. Information on the purpose and general content of each tracker is in the table below.

| Tracker         | Purpose                           | Content                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Experiment tracker | Provides contextual information on the experiments involved in the project | Details each experiment, including research questions, approach, and hypotheses |
| Resource tracker | Provides inventory and annotated information for all data and supporting files | List of data and non-data/supporting files, including description, path, and dependencies |
| Results tracker | Provides detailed information on all multi-result files | List of each result, including type and description; there should be one results tracker per multi-result file |

The Data Packaging tool will provide you with easy-to-understand forms that feed into these trackers. **You will not need to complete them manually within the tracker.** For more information on the fields within each tracker, please refer to the [metadata schemas](../schemas/index.md).
