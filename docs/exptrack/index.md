# About the Experiment Tracker

This tab creates the experiment tracker, which provides context on the experiments involved in the project including research questions, hypotheses, and approach. You may only have one experiment, in which case you only need to go through the process of annotating and adding your experiment to the tracker once. However, if you have multiple experiments in your study, you will need to annotate and add each experiment to the tracker separately.

You will only have one experiment tracker for your study, with one entry per experiment. The experiment tracker shell that you will fill in was created and saved when you created your dsc-pkg folder.
